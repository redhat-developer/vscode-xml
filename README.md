## Requirements

For running the binary version:
  * Windows, macOS, or Linux, on a x86_64 CPU
    * We do not make a binary specific for Apple ARM (Apple Silicon), but the x86_64 binary seems to work through the Rosetta 2 translation layer.
    * We do not currently support running on Linux installations without `libc` present
  * Java is not required for this version
  * The binary is automatically downloaded by vscode-xml if it is needed, with no additional action required on the part of the user.

For running the Java version (required if you want to run [extensions](./docs/Extensions.md#custom-xml-extensions) to the base XML features):
  * Java JDK (or JRE) 8 or more recent
  * Ensure Java path is set in either:
    * `xml.java.home` in VSCode preferences
    * `java.home` in VSCode preferences
    * Environment variable `JAVA_HOME` or `JDK_HOME`
    * **Note**: The path should end at the parent folder that contains the `bin` folder.
      **Example Path**: `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0` if `bin` exists at `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0/bin`.
    * **Note**: If the path is not set, the extension will attempt to find the path to the JDK or JRE.

See [how to set java home](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#java-home) for more information how this extension searches for Java.

## Supported VS Code settings

The following settings are supported:

* [`xml.java.home`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#java-home): Specifies the folder path to the JDK (8 or more recent) used to launch the XML Language Server if the Java server is being run. If not set, falls back  to either the `java.home` preference or the `JAVA_HOME` or `JDK_HOME` environment variables.
* [`xml.server.vmargs`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-vm-arguments): Specifies extra VM arguments used to launch the XML Language Server.
   Eg. use `-Xmx1G  -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication` to bypass class verification, increase the heap size to 1GB and enable String deduplication with the G1 Garbage collector.
* [`xml.server.workDir`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-cache-path): Set a custom folder path for cached XML Schemas. An absolute path is expected, although the `~` prefix (for the user home directory) is supported. Default is `~/.lemminx`.
* [`xml.server.preferBinary`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-binary-mode): If this setting is enabled, a binary version of the server will be launched even if Java is installed.
* [`xml.server.binary.path`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-binary-mode): Specify the path of a custom binary version of the XML server to use. A binary will be downloaded if this is not set.
* [`xml.server.binary.args`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-binary-mode): Command line arguments to supply to the binary server when the binary server is being used. Takes into effect after relaunching VSCode. Please refer to [this website for the available options](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/HostedvsRuntimeOptions/). For example, you can increase the maximum memory that the server can use to 1 GB by adding `-Xmx1g`
* [`xml.server.silenceExtensionWarning`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-binary-mode): If this setting is enabled, do not warn about launching the binary server when there are extensions to the XML language server installed.
* [`xml.server.binary.trustedHashes`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#server-binary-mode): List of the SHA256 hashes of trusted copies of the lemminx (XML language server) binary.
* `xml.trace.server`: Trace the communication between VS Code and the XML language server in the Output view. Default is `off`.
* `xml.logs.client`: Enable/disable logging to the Output view. Default is `true`.
* [`xml.catalogs`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#catalogs): Register XML catalog files.
* `xml.downloadExternalResources.enabled`: Download external resources like referenced DTD, XSD. Default is `true`.
* [`xml.fileAssociations`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#file-associations): Allows XML schemas/ DTD to be associated to file name patterns.
* [`xml.foldings.includeClosingTagInFold`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Folding.md#xmlfoldingincludeClosingTagInFold): Minimize the closing tag after folding. Default is `false`.
* `xml.preferences.quoteStyle`: Preferred quote style to use for completion: `single` quotes, `double` quotes. Default is `double`.
* `xml.autoCloseTags.enabled` : Enable/disable autoclosing of XML tags. Default is `true`.
  **IMPORTANT**: The following settings must be turned of for this to work: `editor.autoClosingTags`, `editor.autoClosingBrackets`.
* [`xml.codeLens.enabled`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/CodeLens.md): Enable/disable XML CodeLens. Default is `false`.
* [`xml.preferences.showSchemaDocumentationType`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Preferences.md#documentation-type): Specifies the source of the XML schema documentation displayed on hover and completion. Default is `all`.
* [`xml.validation.enabled`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md): Enable/disable all validation. Default is `true`.
 * [`xml.validation.namespaces.enabled`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md#xmlvalidationsnamespacesenabled): Enable/disable namespaces validation. Default is `always`. Ignored if [`xml.validation.enabled`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md) is set to `false`.

Default is `always`. Ignored if [`xml.validation.enabled`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md) is set to `false`.
 * [`xml.validation.disallowDocTypeDecl`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md#disallow-doc-type-declarations): Enable/disable if a fatal error is thrown if the incoming document contains a DOCTYPE declaration. Default is `false`.
* [`xml.validation.resolveExternalEntities`](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml/blob/main/docs/Validation.md#resolve-external-entities): Enable/disable resolve of external entities. Default is `false`. Disabled in untrusted workspace.
